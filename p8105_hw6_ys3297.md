Solution to HW6.

## Problem 1

Prepare the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !(city_state %in% c("Tulsa, AL", "Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO"))
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_double(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

For the city of Baltimore, MD, fit a logistic regression with resolved
vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as
predictors.  
Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this
object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted
**odds ratio** for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to
white victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White", "Black"))

baltimore_results = 
  glm(
    resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()
  ) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    odds_ratio = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, odds_ratio, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceBlack") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

baltimore_results
```

| term              | odds\_ratio | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----------: | --------: | --------: |
| victim\_raceBlack |       0.431 |     0.306 |     0.607 |

Run glm for each of the cities in the dataset, and extract the adjusted
odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing black victims to
white victims.

``` r
cities_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White", "Black")) %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())), 
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    odds_ratio_black = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceBlack") %>% 
  select(city_state, odds_ratio_black, starts_with("CI"))
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR.

``` r
odds_ratio_city_plot = 
  cities_results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, odds_ratio_black)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = odds_ratio_black)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  labs(
    y = "OR for solving homicides comparing black victims to white victims",
    x = "City",
    title = "Estimated ORs with CIs for each city"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

odds_ratio_city_plot
```

From the above plot, we can see that the estimated OR for solving
homicides comparing black victims to white victims for most cities in
our prepared dataset was below the null value 1, and none of these ORs
could be concluded to be statistically significantly greater than 1,
while many of them were statistically significantly smaller than 1, at a
significance level of 0.05.
